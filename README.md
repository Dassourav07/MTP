# MTP
# This research aims to develop computational models to predict the phytochemical properties of passion fruit using machine learning techniques, specifically through regression analysis. Passion fruit is known for its high phenolic content and other biologically active compounds, making it a potential natural preservative for food products. 

# The machine learning approach addresses the limitations of traditional in vitro methods, which are often constrained by incomplete and diverse data. By leveraging extensive and heterogeneous datasets on phenolic components and extraction test results, the study aims to predict the maximum Total Phenolic Content (TPC), Total Flavonoid Content (TFC), and Total Carotenoid Content (TCC) for various solvent systems. The research examines the effectiveness of different solvents, revealing that ethanol and methanol are the most efficient for extracting phenolic compounds and carotenoids, respectively. Among the machine learning models evaluated, the Random Forest regression model outperformed others, including Multi-layer Perceptron and Linear Regression, in predicting TPC. The findings offer valuable insights into the impact of solvent selection on the extraction efficiency of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and carotenoids, providing a strategic framework for optimizing extraction methods in phytochemical research.
